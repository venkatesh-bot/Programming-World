Number System And Data Types:
1. Decimal Number System -> Base10, from 0 to 9.
2. Binary Number System -> Base2, 0 and 1.
3. Octal Number System -> Base8, from 0 to 7.

  ex : (32)10 = (?)2
  (37)10 = (?)8

  Data Types :
  1. Primitive DT (allocated in Stack area)
  2. Non-Primitive DT (allocated in Heap area)


  byte, short, int, long
  float, double, boolean, char

  Storing numbers in system :
  for positive numbers it directly converts to decimal to binary and checks the MSB if it is 0 it will store that and retrieve as is.
  for negative numbers it will convert first decimal to binary and checks the MSB if it is 1 it will do the 2's complement of it before storing.
  (1's complement means revers of binary's, then add 1 to convert 2's complement)
   while reading the values it will do the 2's complement first, then it will show the value.
